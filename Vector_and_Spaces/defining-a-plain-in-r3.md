# Defining a plain in r3

equation of plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$  
$$
Ax + By + Cz = D
$$
every $(x, y, z)$ in plane saticfied equation  
normal vector $n$ prependicular to "everything" on the plane and vector $a$ on the plane   
only if $n\cdot a=0$ (it saticfied every vector in the plane)  

Can rewrite?
$n + (x_0, y_0, z_0) \implies Ax + By + Cz = D$  

$X_0=\begin{bmatrix}x_0\\y_0\\z_0\end{bmatrix} X=\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{bmatrix}$  

$X-X_0$ is line on the plane. So, must be prependicular to $n=\begin{bmatrix}n_1\\n_2\\n_3\end{bmatrix}$  
$n\cdot (X-X_0)=0$
this is form $Ax+By+Cz=D$  

This is general form for plane.
